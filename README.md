## Blog API - Management System for Authors

### Description

The Blog API is a robust application designed to facilitate the creation and management of blogs, primarily aimed at authors. The system offers complete functionality for registering new users (authors), creating and managing profiles, as well as features for publishing and managing posts.

With this RESTful API, authors can register, create personalized profiles, write, edit, and delete posts in a simple and efficient manner. The platform also allows you to manage your profile settings for an interactive online presence.

### Technologies
The project was developed using the following technologies:

* TypeScript: Static language based on JavaScript, which provides greater security and clarity in the code.
* NestJS: Progressive framework for building efficient and scalable Node.js applications, used to structure the API.
* Prisma: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to facilitate interaction with the database, making data manipulation simpler and safer.
* PostgreSQL: Robust relational database to ensure data integrity and scalability.
